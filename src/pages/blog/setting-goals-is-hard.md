At the very end of 2022 I had a nice 1 week vacation away from work, since I was still building up the habit of reading I decided to buy a new book to bring along with me. At my local library I found a copy of "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. I've seen this book recomendad everywhere throughout YouTube so I though it would be a nice read during my trip. Something struck me during this read, which reminded me of a YouTube video by one of my favorite tech personalities Theo; "Your Goals Kinda Suck - LEVEL UP As A Developer".

## What are goals?

According to James Clear when quoting Scott Adams:

> Goals are about the result you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

I noticed Theo also mentioned this in his video, we are too focused on what we want to become and we end up overlooking what is needed to make them a reality. Then we also set very ambiguos goals like:

- *I want to learn "x".*

These goals, as said by Theo.

> They don't have a start and end that are clear.

Instead we should try defining a set of actionable steps which will help us accomplish the end goal which in turn is clearly scoped. In my case, I've been struggling to learn Rust for a while for some reason I always loose interest mid way through the official book. So here's how I will define my new goal: "I want to learn Rust in order to build CLI apps which can automate tasks at work like setting up my development environment", yes this feels way more verbose than just "I want to learn Rust" but now I have a well defined scope with a clear deliverable project at the very end. I also need a system which will allow me to gradually reach my new goal.

- *I will read a chapter of the official Rust book at 6 PM on Fridays in my computer.*

Here, I'm deploying an "implementation intention" which specifies a cue for me to perform a certain habit and thus stick with this habit. To develop your own implementation intention you simply fill in the following formula.

- *I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].*

Another tip mentioned in "Atomic Habits" is to chain related tasks in order to make use of the momentum you get from completing a task, for example, after cleaning your room you get the urge to take out the trash. This is known as the "Diderot Effect". Since I would like to apply this knowledge as soon as posible I want to deliver a project each week.

- *After I read a chapter of the official Rust book at 6 PM on Fridays in my computer, I will build a small CLI app applying what I just learned.*

Following some formulas may feel to restrictive, so feel free to tweak your implementation intention as wish. In my case I feel happier with this:

- *Through each day during weekends at 2 PM I will read a chapter of the official Rust for 1 hour, after I'm done with the chapter I will build a CLI application applying what I learned.*

The habit of reading about Rust and applying this knowledge will hopefully push me towards building Something which solves an issue for me (or even other coworkers) which ultimately what programming is all about, solving problems.
