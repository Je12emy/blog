I've always neglected algorithms and data structures after college, maybe my teacher never got me excited for Linked Lists, maybe Java wasn't my cup of tea, maybe I never though of any use case when a simple array list could solve 99% of my issues or maybe college was too hard back then and I had alot on my back. 

I'm a huge fan of [The Primeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen), the way you can feel his excitement when breaking down some very technical topic like [benchmarking Go vs TS vs Rust](https://youtu.be/Z0GX2mTUtfo) is seccond to none. So, when I heard about his course at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) I immediately pushed it to the top of my to-do list.

[The Last Algorithms Course you will ever need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) might be a deceiving name, in fact, there is so much to learn about algorithms and data structures, but that's the point. This course is meant to plant the seeds for you to push forther into this world. In fact, one of the very first lectures we are given some book recommendations like ["Introduction to Algorithms"](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B094WZNKP2) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein  if you desire to seek more knowledge no your own.

On the last lecture, Prime does share a momment with us as a teacher and maybe as a friend about how the world is full oportunities that we take from granted. I also started crying a bit, but finnally after the course was over I felt inspired as a software enginer. To not conform with the simplest and laziest solution, to not do the minimum effort at work and continue learning. For that, I owe him a lot.
