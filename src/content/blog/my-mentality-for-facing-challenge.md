This is something that just recently came to my mind when I was teaching a friend of mine how to drive, my mentality for facing challenges. Challenges or adversity are normal occurrences in life right, hell, if life was devoid of any difficulties it would be boring. There's people who thrive when challenged and there are those who crumble when pushed outside of the comfort zone. I like challenge. I love the learning process and growth afterwards, revisiting and having a retrospective upon what when right, what went wrong and what did I learn provides great value in the long run.

When facing challenge, I like taking it head on, but with a casual mentality. If you are going through a physical challenge, being tensed up won't help at all, it will only make things worse. So, I believe keeping myself relaxed really increases my chances of pulling through. Likewise, I like to consider challenges as just another thing in my routine. Time for my driver's practice exam? Nah, just another driving session. Flipping my mentality really enables me to stay relaxed and focused.

I recently came upon the "Done Manifesto", here are a few points I would like to call out in this context.

- Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.
- Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.
- Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
