Ok, I haven't posted anything for a while. I have a good excuse though, though I don't want to bore you with some medical issues I went through. Besides that, I finally migrated to Astro 2 on my site. I was a little confused while going though the migration docs, what needed most of the work was migrating away from file-based routing for my blog entries by using the new Content Collections. I also updated the site a bit, hope you'll enjoy it!
