I like tinkering with my software, I just wonder how much stuff I can't tune to my liking. I believe this is a very subjective topic, since everyone preaches how they prefer doing actual work rather than tinkering with their settings. In my case, I just enjoy changing things around until I'm satisfied. I always felt intimidated by arch, it is the big boy's distro. After reading the installation process and trying it out on a VM, I though: "Yeah, I can do this". So I burned the ISO into a USB and tried my best, I did fail on my first try. Once I saw arch in my boot menu I was filled with joy, I though it would be harder to be honest.

I'm currently using Awesome WM, I also have Gnome in case I break something within awesome (I may switch to a lighter emergency desktop environment). I gave Hyperland a try, but it just didn't feel polished. I recently had an idea of building an awesome wm's clone in wayland using Rust, maybe a bit too complicated? Who knows...

As for my arch experience... I wouldn't call it revolutionary, flatpak is already capable of filling most of my software needs. Having most packages available through pacman and the aur is nice though, so for the more obscure pieces of software I'm covered. Would I recommend it? Yeah, why not. It's a great learning experience
