I bought a raspberry 4! That means I will be joining the self hosted community, I'm not sure what I might host. I've only added this device to my syncthing devices, so it's barely doing anything so far. I'm interested in moving this blog over, though I have to admit at Vercel has been a great host provider. Maybe hosting an email server for this blog will be my first project. I'll keep you updated!
