Throughout my adult life, I have been described as a disciplined person. A friend of mine has described me "like soldier". I do consider this as a positive perception, but I don't consider my consistency on certain practices as being based on discipline, but rather habit. I've read a couple of books about this topic "The One Thing" by Gary Keller and "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. Their writing styles are rather similar in vibe, and certain topics are mentioned in both books. "The One Thing" has a section dedicated to myths or lies we tell ourselves regarding productivity. One of them is the topic of discipline and willpower.

Willpower, is limited resource. You spend it every time you make a decision, like buying some fruit over candy at the grocery store. Depending on the author, it takes at least 21 days to develop a new habit. During this first period of development, you rely on willpower to stay consistent with your new habit. Overtime, less will power will be needed to perform said habit, to a point where you feel bad when you break away from it. Thus, you are not using your will power anymore, you are just following an already established habit.

This is why I don't consider myself only a disciplined person, but rather a creature of habit. This mentality enables me to make better usage of my willpower to perform other hard tasks, or even use it to develop yet another habit (like blogging).
