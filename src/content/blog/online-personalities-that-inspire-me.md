Lately I've been trying to step away from social media, this includes Twitter (I won't call it "X"), Reddit, Youtube, Instagram and Facebook. Removing all this junk from my phone required little to no effort on my side, I'm not really active on either platform, I just don't like publishing my private life on the internet, it's a scary place once you've spent enough time within it. Still, I consider that there are many valuable online resources which I would like to keep up to date with. So, I picked up an [RSS feed reader](https://flathub.org/apps/io.gitlab.news_flash.NewsFlash) to stay up to date with the latest news. For those youtube channels which post content that I'm explicitly interested in, I use [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) on my phone since that's where I'm doing most of my video content consumption.

This has led me to identify personalities and content creators whom I admire and I would like to start up to date with, these are people which inspire me as a software engineer and even as a human being. So, here's my list.

- [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen): A highly energetic and charismatic role model, every time he shares some knowledge about software engineering and even about life I feel inspired and I greatly look up to him.
- [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate): I have to admit, I stopped learning Go because of his Rust content. The way he is able to share his ideas is highly comprehensive and captivating, you can feel how much dedication he has for his craft.
- [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg): If you want to stay up to date with the hottest and latest trends, Theo is your guy. He provides a great insight into what you need to get things done as a software engineer. I haven't keep up to date with his content because I'm abandoning the Javascript hype-train, but I still enjoy how much knowledge he is able to share.
- [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/): A very recent personality I have discovered, he his the creator of Obsidian, my current knowledge management system (also known as a second brain). His blog isn't centered on technology, but rather, it is based on life advice, which has served very useful for me.

There are many more creators I look up to, but I noticed that these are the ones my mind always drifts towards when setting up a new RSS reader or setting up my subscriptions on New Pipe, so I decided to hopefully give them a shout out.
