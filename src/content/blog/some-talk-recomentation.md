Just wanted to share 2 talks I saw recently. First there's this talk by Michelle Barker titled "Building a greener Web", this was a very interesting topic since we often don't associate our work as software engineers to have a negative impact on the environment. With this new angle, I've started implemented a few of the tips Michelle listed for reducing our impact on the environment.

At my job, we use C# for our backends, while I don't like it, I can appreciate how much of a solid choice it is for many use cases. Just as any typed languages, we often don't pay attention to our business logic on a deeper logic when expressed through types. I recently started reading "Zero To Production In Rust" by Luca Palmieri, and this talk was called out. Domain Modeling Made Functional by Scott Wlaschin seriously opened my eyes at how you can properly and safely define your business logic. I hope I will be able to apply a few of these principles at my work!
