I've been using window manager's for a while, my last Linux setup used Awesome WM. While I've enjoyed tinkering with my configuration, I enjoy the simplicity of everything just working out of the box with a simple Desktop Environment like Pop's Cosmic which provides me more or less with all the benefits you gain from auto tillers. And so, I've decided to step away from window managers for now. I will let you know if I go back, but for now Cosmic seems to be doing just fine!
