I like TMUX, I also like Zellij, I like terminal multiplexers in general. For some time I only stuck with these, avoiding terminals which provided said functionality natively. I have to used Windows at work, WSL is barely functional due to some weird stuff caused by disk encryption and a bunch of security policies, hell, I don't event have admin right on my PC! This means that TMUX, Zellij and the Kitty terminal emulator are not an option for me.

Some years ago I heard of Wezterm, I didn't like it at the time, maybe I wasn't used to the lua configuration file, but now... I love it! Fully configured I can finally bring over my workflow into my windows machine and I finally feel somewhat productive in my terminal. Give it a try!
