Right now, one of my worst current habits is my sleeping schedule. Over this last 2 weeks I have been going to sleep at around 2 am - 3 am which is horrible. While I have been able to pull through work, this is not a good in the long run. Sleep is our super power! So I must threat is a such, I shouldn't neglect it anymore.

# The Plan

Well, since I'm sharing this in my blog, this means that your my dear reader, are now my accountability partner. Hopefully knowing that someone from across the globe is aware of my horrible sleeping habits will motivate me to solve it. Besides that, I've heard and read a ton about how electronic devices destroy our inner clock, so no more screens after 10 pm! It does take me some time to finally fall asleep, so I hope that around 10 pm I should be in bed and by 11 pm I should asleep.

I know there are many more strategies, but this is a start. I already perform a lot of exercise, so much that I worry when my body will give up... For now, let's hope I can solve this.
